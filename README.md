# Image to PDF Converter

A simple and intuitive desktop application built with Python and Tkinter to convert multiple images into a single, organized PDF document.

(Feel free to replace this with your own screenshot of the running application!)

## About The Project

This project provides a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) for selecting, organizing, and converting image files into a PDF. It's designed for anyone who needs a quick and offline tool to compile photos, scans, or other images into a single document without relying on web services.

## Features

- **Multi-File Selection:** Browse and select multiple images (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc.) at once.
- **Image Preview:** See a preview of the currently selected image directly in the application.
- **List Management:**
  - Reorder images using **"Move Up"** and **"Move Down"** buttons to control their sequence in the final PDF.
  - Remove unwanted images from the list.
- **Page Orientation:** Choose between **Portrait** or **Landscape** layouts for your PDF pages.
- **Fit to Page:** Images are automatically scaled to fit within the page while preserving their aspect ratio.
- **Status Bar:** Get real-time feedback on the application’s status, from selecting files to conversion.
